# Testing an RSS Feed with Jasmine

This project contains an RSS Feed, provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) as part of their [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The website contains Jasmime tests that were written by myself.

## How to run the application
This is a web application and will start automatically as soon as you launch index.html. The results of the jasmine tests will be seen at the bottom of the html page.
1. Clone or download the repository on github here: [https://github.com/rlfuller/jasmine-testing](https://github.com/rlfuller/jasmine-testing)
2. Open the index.html file in a browser

## Dependencies
